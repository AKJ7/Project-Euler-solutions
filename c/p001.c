// First Get the number of elements divisible by 3, 5, and 15

// and we are not allowed to count 30 twice.
// Now use the sum rule: sum of integers going from 0 to n is equal to 1/2 * (n * (n+1))
// The total number of multiples of 3 in max is (max - 1) / 3.
// Minus 1, because max itself is not included 
// The sum of all numbers divisible by 3 is then sum of all mutiples of 3 under max.
// Repeat it for 5 and substract the sum of all multiples of 15 to get the result

/*
 * Reading the assembly ouput of getSum() and getSum2(), one might be tricked into thinking that getSum() is faster because it generated 6 assemnly 
 * lines less. It is however very slow because of the branches (from the for loop and the checks if the number is a mutliple of 3 or 5) which would 
 * definitely lead to false branch predictions.
 * When benchmarking, getSum() takes longer and longer, as the while loop increases while getSum2() finishes at a constant time of a couple of milliseconds.
